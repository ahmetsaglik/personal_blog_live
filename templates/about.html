				<p>
					My name is Ahmet Sağlık and I am 25 years old. I graduated from Necmettin Erbakan University
					Computer Engineering Department in 2020. I spent most of my education life dealing with the Python
					Programming Language. During my education, I completed the first of the compulsory internships in
					the IT department of Kipaş Holding. I did my second internship at Tekrom Teknoloji A.Ş. in the R&D
					department. During the internships, I learned a lot about machine learning. I am interested in
					machine learning, deep learning, image processing and data analysis. I have done various projects
					related to these fields. Some of these are “Percent Instant Emotion Estimation”, “Voice Assis-tant”,
					“Electricity Bill Estimation System with Regression Algorithms”,
					“Emotion Analysis with Natural Language Processing”, “Language Prediction System”, “Movie
					Recommendation System”. In addition to these, I was able to compete as a finalist in the Artificial
					Intelligence in Health competition held within TEKNOFEST. I also do backend development with Django
					Framework. I publish the sites I make on Heroku for reference. I have been serving through various
					freelancer sites for the last year.
				</p>

				<h5 class="mt-5">About The Blog</h5>
				<p>
					I plan to use this blog site as a kind of notebook. I take notes on what I have learned. I plan to
					share these notes on the blog. You can find notes on machine learning, deep learning, image
					processing, web development here. <br>
					I hope this blog helps you find what you are looking for.
